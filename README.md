Adoptable Pets

This site is a place for rescue organizations to list all their adoptable animals. The rescue organizations can post updates on the animals. Users can follow the animals and get to know them.

In order to use this site, the Adoptable Pets API must be run first. Go to https://github.com/cy2003/AdoptablePetsAPI and enter 'rails s' in a separate terminal.

Then in the AdoptablePetsSite terminal, run 'npm start'. It will ask if you would like to use a different port. Enter 'Y'.
